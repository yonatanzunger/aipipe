# is the forward-compatible default for every model OpenAI has
# released since the o1 series in late 2024, and continues to be
# the way new models accept token-limit hints.  Treating it as the
# default means future / unknown models work out of the box —
# only the shrinking set of pre-o1 chat models needs special

# date-stamped variants (``gpt-4o-2024-08-06``, ``gpt-3.5-turbo-1106``,
# etc.) are covered without enumerating every snapshot.
#
# **Maintenance**: if a vendor ships a new release in the legacy
# families that still requires ``max_tokens`` — unlikely — add its
# prefix here.  If a legacy model gains support for
# ``max_completion_tokens`` and you want to silently migrate, drop
# its prefix.  See issue #59 for the bug that motivated the
