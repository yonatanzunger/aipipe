"""High-level chat backend abstract base class and generic implementation.
This is how the rest of the clarity-agent interacts with LLMs.

A ``ChatBackend`` provides a conversation-oriented interface for LLM
interaction.  This formalizes the interface shared by all LLM backends,
and is directly provided by AI backends like the Claude Agent SDK.

``ClientChatBackend`` wraps any :class:`~llm.client.LLMClient`
and provides both conversational chat and tool-use loop support. This
is used when you are using a raw LLM API, such as the Azure, OpenAI, or
Anthropic ones.

ChatBackend is a context manager: use it in a ``with`` block to ensure
proper cleanup::

    with config.create_chat_backend(...) as backend:
        response = backend.chat("Hello")

        """Threshold-driven compaction for stateless API providers.

        Run after :meth:`chat` returns to keep the conversation
        under the model's context window.  Stateful provider
        backends (SDK, Copilot) detect their own compaction during
        the chat call and don't need this hook; this implementation
        is the safety-net path for providers that send the full
        history every turn (Anthropic API direct, OpenAI, Azure,
        Gemini).

        Steps:
        1. Ask the transcript whether the threshold is crossed
           (either ``input_tokens`` from this turn's response, or
           the on-disk transcript content size — the rebuild-safety
           half).
        2. If yes: summarize the older 70% via a low-level
           :meth:`LLMClient.create_message` call (bypasses our own
           :meth:`chat`, so no recursion, no transcript writes for
           the summary call itself).
        3. Roll the chapter and replace
           :attr:`conversation_history` with the new chapter's
           messages so subsequent :meth:`chat` calls see only the
           summary plus the verbatim tail.
        4. Fire ``on_compaction_started`` / ``on_compaction_complete``
           callbacks for the orchestrator's UI.
